# Favorite Website
## Synopsis:
This is a small remake of monkeytype.com. This is a typing test website that I thought was really sleek.
Love the layout of the website and simplicity of it looking but has a lot going on at the same time.
- This encompasses what the projects wants to see
- everything on the assignment is somewhere on that one page.
### Upon arrival of home page clicking on the link will bring you to my main page.
There is a Footer and Header navbar on this site.
The forms and button onclick functions are in those sections.
Also utilized the npm install of bootstrap because created custom styles
using scss file.
